Welcome to my new blog built with Gatsby and MDX! This post demonstrates the power of MDX - a format that lets you write JSX directly in your Markdown files.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This means you can:

- Write content in Markdown
- Import and use React components
- Create interactive experiences
- Maintain clean, readable content

<AlertBox type="info">
  MDX files have a `.mdx` extension and can contain both Markdown and JSX.
</AlertBox>

## Code Examples

Here's how you can create a simple React component:

```jsx title="MyComponent.jsx"
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 bg-blue-100 rounded">
      <h3>Hello, {name}!</h3>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```
